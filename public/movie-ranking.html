<h1>The Greatest Movies of all Time According to Randy</h1>
<h2>These are my top 3 movies.</h2>

<h3>22 Jump Street</h3>
<p>
  "Cynn-thiaaaa, jesus died for our Sins-thias". Do I even have to say more?
</p>

<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
<p>
  I think its a classic movie. I love how the directors/writers at the time tried to predict the future.
  Seeing what was depicted in the film compared to living in this era is kind of wild.
</p>

<h3>Hacksaw Ridge</h3>
<p>
  Hacksaw Ridge is my favorite movies because the emotion and thrill of this film really captivated me.
  I think it's really interesting to be a pacifist "fighting in the war"
